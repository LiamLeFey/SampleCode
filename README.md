This is a collection of sample code, written by myself, William Gladen. I use **Liam LeFey** as a *nomme de plume*.

The Java code was written a long time ago. I couldn't find a good [MUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) client that ran on linux and also had a working automapper, so I thought I'd write one.

I got distracted, that project got put on hold, and in the meantime, people wrote [mudlet](https://www.mudlet.org/). So the project is dead, but it's still useful for showing sample code.

The Go code was also written long ago. I learned Go before it was cool. :)

In 2009, I read about the language in a [slashdot article](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/09/11/11/0210212/go-googles-new-open-source-programming-language) and decided to check it out. I thought it was interesting and so decided to learn the language. To do so, I chose to write something in a problem space I was familiar with, so I implemented a persistence backed automapper that could be run as a sub-process of a MUD client, with the tinyfugue client in mind.

It worked, and was pretty good for scripting movement and getting around, but it didn't have a nice gui display.

Anyway, the code here is posted so people can see the quality of code I write.
