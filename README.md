This is a collection of sample code, written by myself, William Gladen. I use **Liam LeFey** as a *nomme de plume*.

Anyway, the code here is posted so people can see the quality of code I write.

I've also included some updates. I found some older versions of code archived, and put the oldest snapshots as the root, and then added the newer versions to show some code evolution.
