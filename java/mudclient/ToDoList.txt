get simple connection to work
write /addworld

MUD!!

write /def

simple compound commands
get triggers working
get multiline triggers working

hook up the mapper

add world discernment (trigger A works on master world, B on slave(s))

add a brute force search?  maybe to PersistentStore? for strings...
this would be usefull if I ever need to search on a note...(which doesn't have
an ID.)

add hooks in Room for wandering exits - connected to Region?
  - they are pretty obviously (usually) region exits... 

aliases

logic and math

hooks

split console screen

At this point you have more than you had with tf.

applet/ajax?

Done!!

incorporate areas & display nicities.

how hard would it be to make it html compat, with mousover stuff?
so what is AJAX anyway?

make SpecialExit more robust, add intelligence to continue the path
  even if we don't know where we will be
  might have to work a lot with path, make it branching, give the
  elements some state, etc etc

a State system seems like a good idea for map.  either attached to a room or
an exit...

Icing!!
